# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions for C#

## Where is Day 1-3?
Patience. I completed them, but I named my original solution AdventOfCode (without a number for the year) so I gave up. I'll add them later, once I clean up the solution.

## What is your general strategy towards completing Advent of Code challenges?
I like to parse the input into an object model and act upon that object model, which typically means it takes a long time to finish the first part of the challenge and is substantially easier for the second part of the challenge. I also don't really see testing as necessarily _useful_ for Advent of Code, but I've included tests here to get instant feedback on whether or not the results were correct, so there are very few tests.

### Your tests are named poorly.
Well, yes, but no. I follow a convention:
`(Method or action name)_(Given input)_(Expected outcome)`

If the expected outcome is simply "successful," "success," or "valid," then  I omit the expected outcome portion.

## Doesn't sharing your code go against Advent of Code's spirit?
I would say yes... but in this case, no. Someone looking up answers does for free stars definitely does, though. **Don't cheat yourself!**
